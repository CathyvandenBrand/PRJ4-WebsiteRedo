    <p>We made the wireframe by using this flow diagram, it made our vision more visible to what and where things should
        go and linked to.</p>

    <h2>Font</h2>
    <p>For our text fonts we used 'Segoe UI' regular and bold, we were going for a simple and casual look. As for the
        logo we used Kollektif, this gives it a professional look to it.
        We also changed some of the colour schemes after feedback.

    <h2>Test Report</h2>
</div>
<div class="user testings">
    <p>We've send out a link to our website to different people and received feedback from it. We aimed to focus on the
        following goals for this user testings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Go from the home page to the product page</li>
        <li>Go over the pictures of the products and look if a pop up shows up.</li>
        <li>Go to the mission page and do the carbon footprint test.</li>
        <li>(phone testers) click on the phone number on the contact page.</li>
        <li>(computer tester) click on the email on the contact page.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Daan van de Ven (computer tester)</strong>: The pages were pretty easy to find in the digital
            prototype but I would prefer to have a slide down navigation bar because if it is just their it takes away
            the charm of the page and overloads a bit to much for me. The green boxes did show up nicely on a lot of
            pictures which always made me curious if they would be their, it also helped to make the pages look less busy
            which was nice. The carbon footprint test was oke but I could not find my way back to the page which was kinda
            annoying so maybe make it pop up as a extra tab. And overall it was nice that I could just click on the
            email tab to send a email without having to type a email in my outlook.
            So overall I like the design and that it looks clean but make sure that all your links work and that it is
            easy to find the page back.</li>
        <li><strong>Ben Spronk (phone tester)</strong>: first of all before I start testing I want to say that you need
            to make the pictures interactive (so make them change with the screen). Overall I could find the pages
            pretty oke and I kinda want to have a scroll down menu because that just looks nicer, the food print test
            was actually interesting to do but it was hard to find my way back to the page so you should fix that and it
            was easy to call the phone number because when I clicked on it it popped up in my phone.</li>
        <li><strong>Daniel Taylor (computer tester)</strong>: The image when you open the menu doesn't work. On the
            Product page, the pop up size is inconsistent. On the Mission page, the text isn't centred. On the Mission
            page, if I hover over the text in the pop-up, I can't click the hyperlink to the test. Email on the Contact
            Us page works. Initially confusing to navigate but once i found the button it was clear, but website overall
            doesnt look appealing, plus few spelling errors.</li>
        <li><strong>Raphael dos Reis Ferreira</strong>: I had to search for the menu to find the products page button.
            Maybe you can put it somewhere at first sight or make the menu button more clear to the view. For example to
            put the word "Menu" next to it. The picture have a text that does pop up. It's not clear where you can press
            to go to the test. Maybe can put the text under the image to avoid confusion. The test works. Don't know if
            I import products to the UK though. The email works on the contact page!</li>
        <li><strong> Robin van den Biggelaar en Kyra van den Lier</strong>: Both of them find the navigation a bit to
            difficult when it was a pop down navigation bar which let us to change it immediately after feedback, and
            recommended under pictures with pop up it would be nice to have some text to indicate that the pictures have
            pop ups and to make people more curious to inspect set pictures, overall they liked the design but would
            love to see more of a green pallet because they say it feels more like recycling.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>With these users testing feedbacks, we will further adjust and improve our website.</p>
<br>
<div class="head text-center">
    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
</div>
<p> some aspects of the page we would love to change after hearing feedback of our digital page these aspects are,</p>
<ul>
    <li>Make the page look more like a nature/recycling page by adding a greener colour scheme.</li>
    <li>Add more in website links to other pages and make of pages better available.</li>
    <li>Make the navigation more available by not having a click down navigation bar but a always available
        navigation
        bar.</li>
    <li>Add text underneath the pictures with pop up so that people know that their is more information within the
        text.
    </li>
    <li>Make picture move with the size of the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to these ideas we are improving the website before the deadline of 13-06-2021 to make the website more
accessible to people on computers and phones<p>
