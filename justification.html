    <h2>Test Report</h2>
</div>
<div calls="user testings">
    <p>We've send out a link to our website to different people and received feedback from it. We aimed to focus on the following goals for this user testings:</p>
        <li>Go from the home page to the product page</li>
        <li>Go over the pictures of the products and look if a pop up shows up.</li>
        <li>Go to the mission page and do the carbon foodprint test.</li>
        <li>(phone testers) click on the phone number on the contact page.</li>
        <li>(computer tester) click on the email on the contact page.</li>
<br>
        <ul><strong>Daan van de Ven (computer tester)</strong>: The pages were pretty easy to find in the digital prototype but I would prefer to have a slide down navigation bar because if it is just their it takes away the charm of the page and overloads a bit to much for me. The green boxes did show up nicely on a lot of pictures wich always made me corious if they would be their, it also helped to make the pages look less busy wich was nice. The carbon footprint test was oke but I could not find my way back to the page wich was kinda annoying so maybe make it pop up as a extra tab. And overall it was nice that I could just click on the email tab to send a email without having to type a email in my outlook. 
        So overall I like the design and that it looks clean but make sure that all your links work and that it is easy to find the page back.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Ben spronk (phone tester)</strong>: first of all before I start testing I want to say that you need to make the pictures interactive (so make them change with the screen). Overall I could find the pages pretty oke and I kinda want to have a scroll down menu because that just looks nicer, the food print test was actually interesting to do but it was hard to find my way back to the page so you should fix that and it was easy to call the phone number because when I clicked on it it popped up in my phone.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Daniel Taylor (computer tester)</strong>: The image when you open the menu doesnt work. On the Product page, the pop up size is inconsistent. On the Mission page, the text isn't centred. On the Mission page, if I hover over the text in the pop-up, I can't click the hyperlink to the test. Email on the Contact Us page works. Initially confusing to navigate but once i found the button it was clear, but website overall doesnt look appealing, plus few spelling errors.</ul>
        <ul><strong>Raphael dos Reis Ferreira</strong>: I had to search for the menu to find the products page button. Maybe you can put it somewhere at first sight or make the menu button more clear to the view. For example to put the word "Menu" next to it. The picture have a text that does pop up. It's not clear where you can press to go to the test. Maybe can put the text under the image to avoid confusion. The test works. Don't know if I import products to the UK though. The email works on the contact page!</ul>

</div>
<p>With these users testing feedbacks, we will further adjust and improve our website.</p>
